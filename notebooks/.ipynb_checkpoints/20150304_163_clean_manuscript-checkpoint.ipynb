      "The characterisation of the evolutionary history and adaptive forces in a close human relative is relevant for understanding our own evolutionary past and susceptibility to disease. Here we use whole genome re-sequencing of 163 vervet monkeys of five sub-taxa sampled across the African continent to infer subspecies relationships and demonstrate cross-taxon gene-flow. Identifying more than 50 million single nucleotide polymorphisms, we find both high diversity within and differentiation across sub-taxa. Unexpectedly, 10% of the common variants are common in all sub-taxa, pointing to potential targets of balancing selection. A scan for balancing selection shows enrichment in un-annotated genes and identifies the MHC and other immune system related genes. A scan for positive selection that makes use of the allele frequency differentiation across sub-taxa is highly enriched in genes whose orthologs have been demonstrated to interact with HIV, pointing to candidate loci for the adaptation to SIV and other viral pathogens."
